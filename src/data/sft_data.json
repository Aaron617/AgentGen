This system should intelligently compare and merge data at the cell level rather than the traditional line-by-line approach used by conventional version control systems like Git. Additionally, the system should recognize that the order of rows in data files is often not significant, thus avoiding unnecessary conflicts during merges when the only difference is the order of rows.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n- compare <file1> <file2>: This action allows you to perform a cell-by-cell comparison between two versions of a data file, highlighting differences in content without considering the order of rows. The effect of this action is that users can easily identify changes or discrepancies at the granular level of individual cells, facilitating a more meaningful understanding of modifications.\n- merge <file1> <file2> <resolution_strategy>: This action enables you to merge two versions of a data file, applying a specified resolution strategy that intelligently handles conflicts at the cell level and disregards row order unless explicitly relevant. The effect of this action is the creation of a single, unified file that incorporates changes from both versions without unnecessary conflict notifications about row order.\n\nYou have the following restrictions on your actions:\n- The comparison must be done at the cell level, ensuring that differences are identified based on the content of individual cells rather than the lines on which they appear.\n- The merge process must allow for resolution strategies that can automatically handle common types of conflicts, such as concurrent edits to the same cell, with minimal user intervention.\n- The system must provide a way to treat the order of rows as significant or insignificant according to user preferences, defaulting to insignificance to reduce the number of merge conflicts.\n- The system must be capable of handling large data files efficiently, ensuring that the compare and merge operations do not become prohibitively slow as file size increases.\n\nTo implement a basic comparison function in your system, consider the following pseudocode:\n\n```\nfunction compareFiles(file1, file2):\n    for row1, row2 in zip(file1.rows, file2.rows):\n        for cell1, cell2 in zip(row1.cells, row2.cells):\n            if cell1.content != cell2.content:\n                print(f\"Difference found at Row {row1.index}, Cell {cell1.index}: '{cell1.content}' vs '{cell2.content}'\")\n```\n\nNote: This pseudocode assumes that each file's rows and each row's cells are accessible in a manner that allows for easy iteration and comparison, and that each cell and row is aware of its own index or position within the file.\nPDDL Domain:"

The precondition for this action is that a move has been made. The effect of this action is the identification of the move as legal or illegal.\n- correct_illegal_move <player> <piece>: This action involves the system enforcing the rule that the player must make a legal move with the same piece, if possible. The precondition is that an illegal move has been detected. The effect is that the player either makes a legal move with the same piece or faces the consequences if no legal move is available.\n- handle_missed_illegal_move <move> <game state>: This action simulates the scenario where an illegal move is not immediately noticed and is later identified. The preconditions include the illegal move being made and then the game proceeding with at least one subsequent move. The effects vary, including potential forfeiture of the game by the player who made the illegal move, depending on the rules being simulated.\n\nYou have the following restrictions on your actions:\n- An illegal move must be detected and corrected before the game can proceed.\n- If a player makes an illegal move and there are no legal moves available with the same piece, the system must enforce the appropriate chess rule, which could vary from forfeiture to a different penalty, based on the simulated rule set.\n- In cases where an illegal move is not noticed immediately, the system must be able to retroactively address the situation in a manner consistent with standard chess rules, which may involve adjusting the game state, penalizing the offending player, or even nullifying the game, depending on the scenario.\n\nYour goal is to maintain an accurate and fair simulation of a chess game where all actions, including the handling of illegal moves, are managed in a way that reflects the complexities and rapid pace of blitz and bullet chess games.

The precondition for this action is that the scratching post is available and the cat has not yet been introduced to it. The effect of this action is that the cat is aware of the scratching post, making it a potential target for scratching.\n- **Apply <catnip> <to_scratching_post>**: This action involves applying catnip to the scratching post to make it more appealing to the cat. The precondition is that the cat has been introduced to the scratching post. The effect is that the scratching post becomes more attractive to the cat, increasing the likelihood of the cat using it.\n- **Place <scratching_post> <near_furniture>**: This action involves placing the scratching post near the furniture that the cat has been scratching.

The effect is that the cat has an alternative scratching option close to its previous target, which may redirect its scratching behavior.\n- **Use <deterrent> <on_furniture>**: This action involves applying a deterrent (such as a spray with an unpleasant scent to cats or double-sided tape) on the furniture that the cat has been scratching. The precondition is that the furniture has been scratched by the cat. The effect is that the furniture becomes less appealing to the cat, reducing the likelihood of further scratching.\n- **Reward <cat> <for_using_scratching_post>**: This action involves giving the cat a reward (such as treats or affection) when it uses the scratching post. The precondition is that the cat uses the scratching post for scratching. The effect is that the cat becomes more likely to use the scratching post in the future due to positive reinforcement.\n\nYou have the following restrictions on your actions:\n- A scratching post can only be introduced to a cat if it has not already been introduced.\n- Catnip can only be applied to a scratching post that has been introduced to the cat.\n- A scratching post can only be placed near furniture if it is appealing to the cat.\n- A deterrent can only be used on furniture that has been previously scratched by the cat.\n- A cat can only be rewarded for using the scratching post if it actually uses it for scratching.\n\nBy following these actions and adhering to the restrictions, the goal is to shift the cat's scratching behavior from the furniture to the scratching post, thereby protecting the furniture while still allowing the cat to engage in its natural scratching behavior.\nPDDL Domain:"

In this world, players can choose to play as different fantasy races, including Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings, a term chosen to avoid direct reference to \"Hobbits\" from Tolkien's works. The game's objective is to complete quests, gather allies, and ultimately defeat a dark lord threatening the land.\n\nThe environment consists of various locations (loc), including forests, mountains, villages, and dark fortresses. Each location has its characteristics, with some being the homelands of allies and others being filled with enemies or natural hazards.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n- travel <from_loc> <to_loc>: This action allows players to move from one location to another, provided the two locations are connected by a path, the player has the necessary provisions for the journey, and the destination is not a natural hazard (e.g., impassable mountains or deep rivers without a bridge). The effect of this action is that the player will be at the new location, ready to engage in new activities such as quests or interactions with characters.\n- recruit <from_loc> <character_type>: This action allows players to recruit allies from the location they are in, if such characters are present and willing to join the player's cause. The effect of this action is the addition of the character to the player's party, enhancing their abilities in combat or other challenges.\n- confront <from_loc> <enemy_type>: This action allows players to engage in combat with enemies if they are present in the location. Success depends on the player's and their allies' strength compared to the enemy's. The effect of a successful confrontation is the defeat of the enemy, possibly yielding rewards or information crucial to the player's quest.\n\nPlayers have the following restrictions on their actions:\n- They cannot travel directly into natural hazards without finding a way around or through them (e.g., finding a guide for a mountain pass or building a boat for a river).\n- They cannot recruit allies from a location if they have not completed the necessary quests or challenges to gain their trust.\n- Combat with enemies requires careful consideration of the player's strength and possibly recruiting more allies or acquiring better equipment.\n\nThis game design task encourages the exploration of a rich, fantasy world while navigating the complexities of alliance-building and combat, all within a setting that pays homage to the inspirations of classic fantasy literature without directly using copyrighted terms.\nPDDL Domain:"
